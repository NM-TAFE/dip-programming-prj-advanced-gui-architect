### Notes: 
Our team modified the program so that it processes the video and extracts code in the background
rather than going to auditory_feedback.html. As a team, we all tried to add timestamps in player.html,
and have extracted code to appear on the right side of the screen, and make the timestamps to navigate the video
and the extracted code.
