#### Summary
I went on and attempt to try replacing the os code in utils.py into pathlib.
However, the challenge is to get the directory of the path as pathlib only looks for the
filepath. I started experimenting and learning pathlib, but haven't yet implemented it.

### Retrospective
By the end of the week, I will try to contribute with the utils.py.
