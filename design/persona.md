- I have a Macbook and Windows desktop. Some programs do not support cross-platform.  
I want to make sure that the program runs well on both devices.

- I want to see all the codes from a video at once, I don't have much time.  

- When something is loading, I want to be able to know the status  

- I often miss what the computer tells me, and I need to go back.
