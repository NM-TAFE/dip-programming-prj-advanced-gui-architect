# Persona: [Alice]

## Background
Alice is a determined computer science university student, learning to code despite facing the challenge of being visually impaired.
She carries a Macbook to school, but she relies on her Windows desktop at home.

## Goals
Alice is eager to watch coding tutorials to enhance her programming skills.

## Needs
"I have a Macbook and Windows desktop. Unfortunately, some programs do not support cross-platform compatibility.  
It's crucial for me that the program runs seamlessly on both devices, so I can learn without any limitations."


# Persona: [Ben]

## Background
Ben is a hardworking computer science university student who balances his studies with a part time job.
Despite his visual impairment, he is determined to broaden his programming knowledge.

## Goals
Ben aims to access comprehensive code examples from lengthy videos to optimise his learning experience.

## Needs
"I want to efficiently access all the code snippets from a video at once, as time is precious for me.
While I may not be able to watch an entire 6 hours video, having access to the whole extracted code is invaluable.
I also want to be informed of any loading status."

# Persona: [Dan]

## Background
Dan is a resilient computer science university student who recently lost his sight due to an accident.
Adjusting to life without vision, he is committed to continuing his coding education.

## Goals
Dan uses this program to continue his journey of learning how to code.

## Needs
"I often struggle to catch all the information conveyed by the computer due to my recent loss of sight.
Having the ability to easily backtrack and review content is essential for me to grasp the concepts effectively."
